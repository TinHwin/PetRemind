**Description**

All pet owners know that taking care of a pet can be a lot of work, and your duties toward your pet can be easily forgotten after a long busy schedule. Duties such as taking your dog out for walks, cleaning your cat’s litter, should not be side tracked. It’s due to reasons such as these that PetRemind set out to motivate pet owners to ensure that their companions are being taken care of and provide a voice to these pets about having the best treatment possible. PetRemind is a website application whose main goal is to provide assistance to pet owners when it comes to taking care of their pets. Whether your daily schedule is packed, PetRemind will also make sure your pet is not being forgotten and ensure your pets needs are being fulfilled.

**Features**

To get started, new users are able to create a new PetReminder’s account by just logging into our website using their Google account credentials. This is to streamline the logging in and signing out process for the user while providing security protection to both the user and PetRemind as their data is secured by Google. Upon signing in, PetRemind allows users to manage all their pets' profile needs. Users can create a new pet profile by entering their pet’s basic information. After creating the pet profile, users can click on their pet profile card, which will navigate the user to check the daily tasks schedule, long term reminders, or their medical record. And if the unthinkable happens, PetRemind also allows the option to delete or remove a pet from your account. One of our website's main features is the ability for users to create a weekly schedule for your pet’s daily needs such as going out for walks, and feeding time. This is to ensure that pet owners will remember what daily tasks are needed to be completed at certain times. Additionally, if pet owners want long term goals that could be weeks or months from now such as saving up emergency funds, they can add a long term reminder that reminds them with emails notifying them about the upcoming deadline. These long goals are different from daily tasks as they’re mostly a one off thing and usually don't follow a schedule like tasks. Additionally, PetRemind provides users the option to enter their pet’s medical information to be stored inside the pet’s profile as it can be a simple and quick way for users to easily retrieve crucial information about their pet without having to dig for their medical papers for information such as their veterinarian’s contact. 
On the other hand, besides the main features that users will be utilizing to manage their pets’ needs, PetRemind also ensures that the pet owners themselves will also appreciate features that make their lives a bit easier. Features such as quickly, simply, and securely logging using their Google account will allow them or anyone they trusted to take care of their pet to also manage the same pets just by logging to PetRemind using the same Google account. This feature allows multiple pet owners of the same pet to retrieve their pet information such as daily schedule and medical information. Additionally, PetRemind has adapted their UI/UX to be compatible with both desktop and mobile application websites to ensure that no matter what device and where they are, they will be able to access PetRemind. In the end, pets are one's companion, sometimes even family, therefore, it's essential that their wellbeing is being taken care of to the best of our ability. PetRemind is here to ensure that pet owners will not forget simple tasks by providing many features that also makes their lives a bit easier while providing assistance about how to take care of their pets and allowing them to live a happy simple life.
